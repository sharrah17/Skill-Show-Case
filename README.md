# Skill-Show-Case


### Hi All! THis repository is meant to show off a few projects I completed using python and SAS. Below is a list and explanation of all the projects in this repository.

- In this project, I used python to clean, process, and analyze EEG data by applying various ML models to the data. In the folder is the jupyter notebook and research poster for the project.
- Located here is learning material I prepared for my peers that covers implementing ML models in Python. Jupyter notebooks contains data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- Located here is brief SAS code to showcase that I am capable of working with SAS.
