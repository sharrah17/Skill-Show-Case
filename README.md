## Python and SAS Skill Show Case


### Hi all! This repository is meant to show off a few projects I completed using Python and SAS. Below is a list and explanation of all the projects in this repository.

#### EEG Data Analysis Folder: 
- Located here is a project where I used Python to clean, process, and analyze EEG data by applying various ML models to the data. In the folder is the Jupyter notebook and research poster for the project. 

#### ML Mini Lessons Folder:
- Located here is learning material I prepared for my peers that covers implementing ML models in Python. The Jupyter notebook contains data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.

#### SAS Code Folder: 
- Located here is SAS code used to briefly analyze Palmer Penguin data. This brief code is meant to show that I am capable of working with SAS.
