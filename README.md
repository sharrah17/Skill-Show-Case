### R, Python, and SAS Skill Showcase


#### Hi all! This repository is meant to show off a few projects I completed using R, Python, and SAS. Below is a list and explanation of all the projects in this repository.



#### Houston BCycle Data Analysis Folder: 
- Located here is a project where I used R to clean, prepare, and analyze 2021 data from Houston BCycle. In this project, I used Houston BCycle data, and outside data, to conduct exploratory data analysis, create a bubble map of Houston BCycle station locations, and create a mutiple linear regression model to see if variables such as day of the week, holiday, and temperature (along with a few other variables) have an effect on the amount of bike checkouts per day. In the folder is a RMD file showing the R code used to clean, manipulate and prepare datasets along with the R code used to analyze the data. Additionally, in the folder is a HTML report/presentation for the project showing my visualizations, code, and statistical findings. To view the HTML, you will first need to download the file and then open it by double clicking on it in hte location the HTML was downloaded to. 


#### Serena Williams WTA Data Analysis Folder:


#### EEG Data Analysis Folder: 
- Located here is a project where I used Python to clean, process, and analyze EEG data by applying various ML models to the data. In the folder is the Jupyter notebook and research poster for the project. 


#### ML Mini Lessons Folder:
- Located here is learning material I prepared for my peers that covers implementing ML models in Python. The Jupyter notebook contains data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis using Python.


#### SAS Code Folder: 
- Located here is SAS code used to briefly analyze Palmer Penguin data. This brief code is meant to show that I am capable of working with SAS.
